# Where to Find Out More About SYCL?

## ComputeCpp Documentation

Codeplay Software offer a free "Community Edition" of ComputeCpp, their SYCL v1.2.1 conformant implementation and the [developer website](https://developer.codeplay.com) includes guides and documentation for SYCL developers.

## SYCL Sample Code

There is a good set of SYCL sample code published on [GitHub](https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/computecpp-sdk/) and this repository also contains some more substantial SYCL demo projects for [N-Body simulation, Game Of Life and Mandelbrot](https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/computecpp-sdk/tree/master/demos).

## SYCL Videos

If you'd like to watch a SYCL talk, there are some great talks online including Gordon Brown at CppCon 2018 ["A Modern C++ Programming Model for GPUs using Khronos SYCL"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miqZS6aS9K0)
You can find more SYCL related presentation videos at [sycl.tech](http://sycl.tech/) 

## SYCL Frameworks

There are a growing number of Frameworks that are accelerated using SYCL. Some of these are listed on the [Codeplay developer website](https://developer.codeplay.com) and they include:

 * [SYCL-DNN](https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/SYCL-DNN)          A project offering operations for convolutions that can be used to build machine learning applications
 * [SYCL-BLAS](https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/sycl-blas)         A project offering BLAS operations
 * [Eigen](https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/sycl-blas)             A C++ linear algebra library using SYCL for tensor operations
 * [SYCL Parallel STL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SyclParallelSTL) A project that implements ParallelSTL using SYCL
